ABOUT THEME

Muso is a blog theme designed specifically for musicians and bands. It can function as a regular blog theme,
but includes some special features likely to appeal to bands and musicians. You can set a full sized featured 
image on the home page with your logo or name layered on top, which is a great way to make a strong first impression. 
You can also embed your latest track or playlist from Soundcloud or Mixcloud, and optionally feature a carousel 
which is great for promoting tour dates.
